# Drunkwood
a context-free grammar for generating situations of drunkenness with achewood characters and such as that

###How to Use
you'll have to have python installed, and run the python shell, get into the drunkwood directory and type:
'python contextfree.py S <drunkwood_grammar.json'

###How to Edit
To edit the word bank open drunkwood_grammar.json and mess around, should be sufficiently commented to figure out but lemme know if you have question. Shouldn't need to change anything in contextfree.py

###Credits
