# Drunkwood
a context-free grammar for generating situations of drunkenness with achewood characters and such as that

###Examples
_Lyle and Ray get a little imprecise with the help of some margaritas and such as that._
_Nice Pete and Lyle become spry on much old whiskey until Teodor shows up with some margaritas and it sincerely becomes a time._
_Cornelius and Todd be gettin' all puzzled with the help of some old whiskey and such as that._
_Roast Beef and Frank get a little rutty on some grolsch._

###How to Use
you'll have to have python installed, and run the command line / teminal, get into the drunkwood directory and type:

`python contextfree.py S <drunkwood_grammar.json`

###How to Edit
To edit the word bank open drunkwood_grammar.json and mess around, should be sufficiently commented to figure out but lemme know if you have question. Shouldn't need to change anything in contextfree.py
